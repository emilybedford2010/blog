Once there was a tiger shark named Terry.  He lives in an amazing place called the Great Barrier Reef. 

Terry is only 9 and is at the age where Tiger Sharks hit adolescence.

"I have decided to enter the Carnivore Cup" he said to his family.

"Why?" they asked. 

"Because I want to prove myself to the world" he replied.

"When is it?" they asked again.

"In two days" Terry replied back again.

"And i'm leaving tomorrow." Terry added before going upstairs to bed.

The  next day Terry left for the carnivore cup taking only his tooth brush and his running shoes.

Terry was nervous but exited, he had traveled a very long way and was starting to get a little pekish.

Sharks eat almost anything and it just so happend that Terry came across something that he thought was yummy.

"yum food!" said Terry racing to the thing."Ewwwww" said Terry.   

"Its a shoe!". Sharks will eat anything but if they don't like it they spit it right back out.  Then something drifted past in the shadows.

"Real food" he said excitedly racing towards the food.

"It's a green sea turtle" said Terry eating the poor turtle.

Its just the way of life. 

After a big meal Terry set off again. Not long after after Terry left he could see the stadium.

"We made it!" said Terry as he raced inside and was greeted by a loud noise over the sharkspeakers.

"Sharks you have to do three laps around the oval. Racers to the starting point".

As Terry headed over to the starting point he spotted Percy the perfect, Dan the dribler, Stanley the strong, Pat the pacer, Frankie the fast and Melbourne the muscle.

"**On you marks! get set! gooooooooooooooooooooo!**" the starter began as the spectators cheered!

The racers bolted out of the starting blocks with Stanley the strong in first place and Melbourne close behind. Terry and the rest of the pack followed behind about 5 metres back.

The first lap finished with Stanley the strong still leading.

Terry sped up and took over Melbourne

Then Dan dribbled spit all over the ground, Dan took of at full speed, Terry swam over the pool of spit.

While every one else fell down. Terry sped up and he caught up with Dan.  Tiger sharks can swim up to 2.4mph but can only swim this fast for only a number of seconds.

Terry passed Dan and finished the second lap in first place with Dan gaining on Terry.

Dan slipped over and spun around and head clashed with Melbourne!

Terry ran the last lap and came first!

"I won i won iiiiiiiiiiii wonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"said Terry very proud.

"I'm going to tell everyone in my whole family "he said proudly 

But untill then goodbye!
