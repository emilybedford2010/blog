# Cheetahs are cool!

![credit:https://www.livescience.com/27319-cheetahs.html](https://img.purch.com/w/660/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzEwMi8yOTQvb3JpZ2luYWwvY2hlZXRhaDEuanBn)

Cheetahs are the fastest animals on earth, they live in really hot places like Africa.

> **FUN FACT!** - 
> Did you know that a Cheetah can run at speeds up to 120 kilometres per hour! 

When a Cheetah is born, they are dependent on their mother for *two* years.  Their mother provides food, shelter and safety from predators! 

Cheetahs have big strong legs and strong teeth.  They use their legs for catching their breakfast,lunch, dinner or even just a snack.

Cheetahs use their teeth for eating any type of meat.  Most Cheetahs use their black spots and golden fur to blend in to the long grasses when they're catching food or when     they are being hunted.

The Cheetah population is very low - in fact they are endangered! They are endangered because:

1. Cheetahs are being poached for their beautiful fur
1. Their habitat is being demolished, and
1. They are losing their hunting grounds.

We need to take care of all our beloved Cheetahs. If we don't they will be gone **forever**.
